# AI Astrology ✨🌙

AI Astrology is a web app that generates AI-powered astrological readings from user-provided birth information. The interface provides a friendly, purple-themed form where users can enter their name, birth date, birth time, birth place, select a zodiac sign and reading type, then generate a personalized reading.

## Features
- New Reading / Current Reading / History tabs
- Collects: name, birth date, birth time, birth place, zodiac sign, reading type
- Generates readings using an AI backend (OpenAI or other models)
- Saves reading history locally or via backend (depending on project setup)
